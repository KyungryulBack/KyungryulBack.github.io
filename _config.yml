  Hello. I'm 경렬, an undergraduate Student at Korea University. 
  I have been fortunate to have some great opportunities to work on various projects and activities, collaborating with individuals from diverse backgrounds. 
    
  I am extremely passionate about exploring the cutting-edge fields of AI, generation model and NLP. I am eager to further my education and experience in these exciting areas.
  
  Currently, I am focusing on a NLP project of the course COSE461, Persona chatbot[TBD] using the dialog generation BOB model and HFRL, hoping to make a great chatbot with my teamates. 

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> , <mark>Huggingface</mark> , <mark>Team projects</mark> , <mark>Sports and Games</mark>

          This was the first group project I had worked on related to AI, aimed to imitating the Dall-E. \n
        
          As a result of working on this project, I developed a keen interests in [NLP] and [Generative models].
          
          We decided to create a text-to-image multimodal using a CLIP model. Since this was our first AI project, we studied intensively every day and tried to catch up the model.

          In this project, I tried tuning the LSTM model. I tried changing both the hyperparameter and the hidden layer of the Conv-LSTM model. 
        
          The intersting thing was by rule of thumb, I learned that batch normalization didn't really work well in the LSTM model and found the Hinton's LayerNormalization and tried chaning the baseline model with it.

            Working as an Undergraduate Intern in AIM lab was turly meaningful. Thanks to my Advisor, Prof. Joongheon Kim I learned about working as a researcher and engineer.   
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            At AIM Lab, I studied about the Quantum Machine learning, studying the monograph 
            “An introduction to quantum machine learning for engineers” by Osvaldo Simeone.
            I participated in weekly seminars as a penalist and presentor, discussing the contents about this monograph. Furthermore, to gain a practical experience in
            translating research papers into a code, I made some quantum circuits from scratch by python code. 
            Also I joined a project with *Solvit System*, researching about the 
            *Optimal Positioning Algorithms for Wide-Area Relaying Networks*. 
            Moreover, I presented *Reinforcement algorithms and simulations using Unity platform* 
            at the KICS workshop. As opportunities to present in front of a large audience, 
            in a official acedemic place are relatively rare for undergraduates, 
            this experience was valuable.

          After transfering to Korea.Univ, studying Electrical Engineering and AI was challenging, though I enjoyed I tried my best to fit into the school well. 

          I received a dean's list in 2022 Spring in Korea Univ.
          
          Some courses I took related to AI & NLP: Artificial Intelligence, Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Theroy and Inference Learning, Probability and Random Process, Introduction to Linear Algebra, Data Structure and Algorithm
          
          Also I'm a committe member of four clubs, *HandS* (Electrical Engineering Club), *DevKor* (Software developing Club), *Quick* (Quantum studying club), *Deluxe* (Gaming club)

          During my time at Dongguk I found my talent in project leading as well as social activies. 
                    
          2019, I was a member of a Student Council, *총학생회 한걸음* working as a *Director of Sports* managing the University's sports events and realted clubs.
          
          I received Academic Excellence scholarship in 2019 Fall at Dongguk (rank: 1/66), with total GPA 4.23/4.5 , Major 4.38/4.5

          Industrial Engineering was attractive, but I desired to study in a more large group, as well as learning some advanced engineering knowledge. So I transferred to Korea University 2022.
