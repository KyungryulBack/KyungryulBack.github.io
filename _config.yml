  Hello. I'm 경렬, an undergraduate Student at Korea University. 
  I am passionate about exploring the cutting-edge fields of AI, generative model and NLP. I am eager to further my education and experience in these exciting areas.
  
  I have previously completed courses : Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing at Korea Univ
  
  I am currently focusing on further studies related to my previous NLP project of the course COSE461, MBTI-Based Dialogue Generation. 
  
  My research interest is about making human-like agent <mark>AGI</mark>, <mark>HCI</mark>, Large Language Models <mark>LLM</mark>, <mark>GNN</mark>.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> , <mark>Huggingface</mark> , <mark>Team projects</mark> , <mark>Sports and Games</mark>

          This was the first group project I had worked on related to AI, aimed to imitating the Dall-E. 
        
          As a result of working on this project, I developed a keen interests in NLP and Generative models.
          
          We decided to create a text-to-image multimodal using a CLIP model. Since this was our first AI project, we studied intensively every day and tried to catch up the model.

          In this project, I tried tuning the LSTM model. I tried changing both the hyperparameter and the hidden layer of the Conv-LSTM model. 
        
          The intersting thing was by rule of thumb, I learned that batch normalization didn't really work well in the LSTM model and found the Hinton's LayerNormalization and tried chaning the baseline model with it.

          In this project, we are planning to make a MBTI-Consistent-Dialog-Generation model, simply a chatbot. 

          We made a MBTI related dataset ourselves, planning to train it by RLHF methods and finetuned both the KoGPT2 and k-BOB model. 

          We achieved a Perfect Score on this project. (1st among 50 teams)

            Working as an Undergraduate Intern at the AIM Lab was truly meaningful. Under the guidance of my advisor, Prof. Joongheon Kim, I learned an invaluable insights about how to become a responsible and great researcher.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            At AIM Lab, I studied about the Quantum Machine learning, studying the monograph 
            “An introduction to quantum machine learning for engineers” by Osvaldo Simeone.
            I participated in weekly seminars as a penalist and presentor, discussing the contents about this monograph. Furthermore, to gain a practical experience in
            translating research papers into a code, I made some quantum circuits from scratch by python code. 
            Also I joined a project with *Solvit System*, researching about the 
            *Optimal Positioning Algorithms for Wide-Area Relaying Networks*. 
            Moreover, I presented *Reinforcement algorithms and simulations using Unity platform* 
            at the KICS workshop. As opportunities to present in front of a large audience, 
            in a official acedemic place are relatively rare for undergraduates, 
            this experience was valuable.

          After transfering to Korea.Univ, studying Electrical Engineering and AI was challenging, though I enjoyed I tried my best to fit into the school well. 

          I received a dean's list in 2022 Spring in Korea Univ.
          
          Courses I took related to AI & NLP: Artificial Intelligence, Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Information Theroy and Inference Learning, Probability and Random Process, Introduction to Linear Algebra, Data Structure and Algorithm
          
          Also I'm a committe member of four clubs, *HandS* (Electrical Engineering Club), *DevKor* (Software developing Club), *Quick* (Quantum studying club), *Deluxe* (Gaming club)

          During my time at Dongguk I found my talent in project leading as well as social activies. 
                    
          2019, I was a member of a Student Council, *총학생회 한걸음* working as a *Director of Sports* managing the University's sports events and related clubs.
          
          I received Academic Excellence Scholarship in 2019 Fall at Dongguk (rank: 1/66), with 
          
          Total GPA 4.23/4.5 , Major 4.38/4.5
